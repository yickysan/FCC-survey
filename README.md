# FCC-survey

This repository  contains data collected by freecodecamp in 2021 on new coders. As a coder myself, I was interested in the landscape of coding so I wanted to know what other coders are up to.
I had a couple of questions in my head and I have tried my best to answer them given the data I had.

## Requirements

Like all data anlysis done with python, you need pandas, matplotlib, seaborn. If you don't alread have those libraries installed, you can install it using `pip install pandas` in command line.
